# WARNING

This is an educational-only implementation of the proposed [Schnorr BIP](https://github.com/sipa/bips/blob/bip-schnorr/bip-schnorr.mediawiki) with the following features:

* Non efficient
* Non secure
* Non costant time
* A lot of heap allocation
* A lot of avoidable copy of memory
* Poor understanding of underlying math
* Lot of TODOs 

That said, it looks it currently pass the [test vectors](https://github.com/sipa/bips/blob/bip-schnorr/bip-schnorr.mediawiki#test-vectors) of the Schnorr BIP

```
cargo test --release
